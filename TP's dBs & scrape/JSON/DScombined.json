These positions will augment and extend a team whose primary goal is to identify and extract utility and value from the deployment of Seer’s proprietary technologies in the proteomics-focused, molecular-profiling space. In essence, Seer will use a mass spectrometry-based platform to develop high-dimensional data sets from clinical studies that focus on a variety of indications and potential utilities. Using Seer’s technology in conjunction with a cutting edge mass spectrometry (MS) profiling platform, the Data Science team will focus on methods for primary MS data acquisition and analysis, higher-order data value development via machine-learning approaches (i.e., classification problems), and data storage, visualization, and interrogation methods to provide value. As stated above, Seer’s vision is to leverage its proteomics data acquisition and analysis expertise tobetter understand and deal with the progression of disease, the effectiveness of therapies, and the recovery to health.Seer has a number of Data Science functions to augment and expects to hire two to four staff in order to most effectively cover those functions. These functions include statistical analysis in a high-dimensional data mode, bioinformatic annotation analysis, machine learning and classification, database development and management, informatics pipeline development and management, and scientific software development. Given the varied experience and expertise of well-qualified staff in this area including unique breadths of skills, Seer does not see it as a given that there is a 1-to-1 match between new hires and the functions listed above. Seer prefers to hire the best individuals it can find who match Seer’s goals with the individuals’ experiences and expertise to form the best performing team in the proteomics molecular profiling space.RESPONSIBILITIESAreas of specific responsibility and attention for the multiple open positions at Seer will include the following:Assay design for mass spectrometryMass spectrometry assays come in many flavors, some of which (e.g., targeted MS) require prior analysis to understand and identify intended targets for data acquisition within the instrumentation. The Data Science group will help to enumerate the targets for such assays and define the specific molecular components for MS data collection. Examples include prioritized assay targets, proteoform variant identification for those targets (e.g., post-translational modifications, SNPs, etc.), and specific molecular fragments or transitions selected for primary quantification.Primary data acquisition for mass spectrometryThe ability of mass spectrometry instrumentation to collect highly varied data requires a significant level of effort and expertise ensure the best possible value experimental results. Examples include the identification and selection of various instrument parameters such as inclusion and exclusion lists, dwell times, collision energies, isolation windows, etc., all of which can be key leverage points.Proteomics data secondary analysis and annotationMS-based proteomics primary data are comprised by a highly complex set of data relationships including parameters such as charge state, adducts, fragmentation modes and patterns, peptide sequence identifications (including de novosequencing), implied protein and physiological pathway annotations, etc. The totality of MS-derived proteomics-based molecular profiling data represent a wonderful playing field for expert data scientists to identify and capture value for various downstream utilities and applications.Classification problems using proteomics and other omics-based dataAt its most basic level, Seer will use its proprietary technology and molecular profiling platform to identify classification tools for disease state identification, efficacious treatment selection, adverse event avoidance, recurrence monitoring, and, conversely, health and wellness monitoring and enhancement. In all of these goals, the traditional modes & methods of classification and novel machine learning techniques will be deployed. At a higher level, the totality of the data Seer envisions collecting across all of its studies will enable avenues for meta-analysis that are otherwise unavailable in traditional biotech settings. In other words, there are things Seer knows it wants to look for – it also fully expects to discover things it didn’t originally set out to identify.Data engineeringGiven the highly varied types and amounts of MS-based molecular profiling data that Seer plans to accrue in its various internal and collaborative studies, Seer will put in a place a robust and scalable infrastructure that provides tools from initial assay development all the way through to final classification and annotation.Data and analysis storage and retrievalInformation without access is pointless – in addition to creating and annotating various forms of data and analytical results from its profiling studies, Seer also expects to create and provide tools for the visualization and extraction of that data in order to enable the desired utility and value creation.QUALIFICATIONSThe successful candidates for these positions must have a demonstrated record of accomplishments in academia or the life sciences industry. The ideal candidates will have had significant experience working with high-dimensional data as applied to classification problems along with all of the associated tools and techniques necessary for that workCandidates must bring a strong entrepreneurial orientation along with teamwork skills and an absolute commitment to competing with the highest level of integrity.Key requirements include:BS or equivalent experience in a field related to data science including data acquisition, analysis, and annotation. Higher degrees are valued, but experience and expertise are the dominant requirements.A minimum of 3 years experience in academic or industry settings in which high-dimensional data acquisition, analysis, and annotation were employed (5+ years experience preferred, omics-related data analysis preferred, biotech start-up experience preferred).The tools and techniques utilized with the Data Science group for the functions described above are highly varied. They include off-the-shelf analytical packages focused specifically on mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis as well as roll-your-own tools for the same. At some level, the requirement is to select from the best currently available tools and augment with Seer developed technology. Examples of tools and platforms currently employed at Seer include; Python, R, SQL, Git, AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, RDS, SageMaker, Athena, Glue…) Linux, Plot.ly, D3 and rShiny. MS tools include; MaxQuant, Scaffold, OpenSWATH, Perseus, Skyline, SeeMS and MSConvert.Strong written and oral communications skills, with demonstrated experience in cross-functional and timely communicationStrong and collaborative work ethic; must be a self-starter and persistent in achieving objectives to support Seer’s scientific and business goalsMust work well in a small team setting, with ability to work independently and collaboratively, while meeting scheduled deadlines in a fast-paced environmentHighly organized, exceptional attention to detail, and strong proficiency in documentation skillsCOMPENSATIONAn attractive compensation package, including competitive benefits and significant stock options, will be offered based upon background and experience.Job Type: Full-timeExperience:high-dimensional data acquisition, analysis, or annotation: 3 years (Preferred)proteomics or genomics data: 3 years (Preferred)Python, R or SQL: 3 years (Preferred)Education:Bachelor's (Preferred)Location:South San Francisco, CA 94080 (Preferred)1 day ago If you require alternative methods of application or screening, you must approach the employer directly to request this as Indeed is not responsible for the employer's application process.","Company":"Seer","Location":"South San Francisco","Skills_List":["Python","d3","Machine Learning","R","Bachelors"],"Job_Posting_URL":"https://www.indeed.com/jobs?as_and=data+scientist&as_phr=&as_any=&as_not=&as_ttl=data+scientist&as_cmp=&jt=all&st=&as_src=&salary=&radius=0&l=CA&fromage=any&limit=50&sort=date&psf=advsrch/company/Seer-Biosciences/jobs/Data-Scientist-Senior-Data-Scientist-5a691668852dbea9?fccid=08336f22bd531b43&vjs=3","Job_Scrape_Date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1541099144980"}},"Posted_Days_Ago":"1 day ago"}}
